[FINISHED 23/9]
+ Merge mouse and keyboard bitset into 1
+ Merge All KeyCode enums into 1 enum class.
+ Make 1 function for IsKeyPressed/Released/Down instead (We do not need explicit ones if above is fixed).
+ Refactor Keybind to have a bitmask instead of vector of input keys. (Fast bitwise lookup)
+ Add container to retrieve all Keybinds using a certain 'key'. (To get fast lookup to check if we should FireEvent).
+ Use Key Enum in input.h instead.
+ Remove Update-loop from InputHandler (checking keybinds) and 
  make Input notify InputHandler when a key is pressed (Maybe also only a key that is part of a keybind / Global KeybindMask).
